## REACT COUNTER 
A simple counter with +1 and -1 buttons, reset button.<br/>
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate and understand the react useState hook basic usage.
This simple app was written with stackblitz which I highly recommend for on the go and learning-oriented react/Angular projects.
